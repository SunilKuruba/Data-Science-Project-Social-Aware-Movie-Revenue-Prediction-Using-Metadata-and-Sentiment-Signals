        "This project focuses on predicting movie box office revenue using structured metadata and enriched social sentiment/emotion signals. The goal is to understand how public perception influences movie performance and improve prediction accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset\n",
        "We used an enriched version of the TMDB dataset, which includes the following key features:\n",
        "- Basic metadata: budget, runtime, vote average/count, release date, etc.\n",
        "- Categorical: language, status, director, production company, genres\n",
        "- Engineered: release year/month, cast/genre/keyword counts\n",
        "- Social Signals (new): sentiment and emotion scores\n",
        "\n",
        "## Workflow Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing\n",
        "- Removed missing/invalid rows\n",
        "- Normalized column names\n",
        "- Converted `release_date` to datetime\n",
        "- Added features like `release_year`, `release_month`, `cast_count`, `genre_count`, `keyword_count`\n",
        "- Extracted top 50 directors and production companies; encoded others as 'other'\n",
        "- One-hot encoded categorical columns for XGBoost and LightGBM\n",
        "- For CatBoost, used categorical column support directly\n",

        "#### Added 9 new features:\n",
        "- Sentiment: `very_negative`, `neutral`, `very_positive`\n",
