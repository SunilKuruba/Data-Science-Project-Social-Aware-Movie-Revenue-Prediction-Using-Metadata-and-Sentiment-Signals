UgxE5_fL3Lyd0d1XIcp4AaABAg,pBk4NYhWNMM,Barbie | Main Trailer,Warner Bros.,"As an older woman, I decided to watch ""Barbie"" to see what all the fuss was about. It started out cleverly, and was even funny. Then it got too serious, trying to be some kind of social commentary. I didn't like the opening scene, with the ""Barbie"" overseeing young girls destroying their baby dolls and doll house toys. Seemed a lot of ""feminist overkill"" to me, and needless violence. Anyhow, by the time it ended, I was DISAPPOINTED. Hollywood should get off the ""social movement"", and get back to ENTERTAINMENT.",@marytica123,2025-03-17T15:53:18Z,1,-0.7891927361488342,0.016013866290450096,0.1787794977426529,0.8052065968513489,0.17816807329654694,0.003756609046831727,0.003983350470662117,0.12470044940710068,0.013470426201820374,0.45491164922714233,0.22100940346717834
