Too bad those explicit scenes have limited the audience for this very relevant film.

Why indulge in something so petty and common as sex when the truth of Atomic devastation could have been depicted explicitly?

Too Political?

Too offensive?

Unprofitable?

Why not EDUCATE people so we DO NOT FORGET?! 

I know people were worried about the Nazis producing the first Atomic bomb, and rightly so, but it was America's research that made it possible for the Russians and Chinese to instigate Mutual Assured Destruction.

UgzWqPgpH3OlzSzgiWJ4AaABAg,bK6ldnjE3Y0,Oppenheimer | Official Trailer,Universal Pictures,"Oppenheim: It is a puzzling, dreadful story that waffles on and on without the true science fiction and technology of concocting the atomic bomb. This cinematic story was all over the place, an amalgamation of intricate and twisted plots, making it tough for any viewers to comprehend and digest. It is somewhat sketchy on top of ambiguous around the storyline I must say.

This film started off being humdrum with a group of people gathering around a table, interrogating Oppenheim about his motives and intentions for creating this atomic bomb. I was initially enthralled with how the film goes back and forth between the past as well as the future but was let down as the story rolled on. 

Besides that, the director wasn‚Äôt ingenious enough to make things straight and go to great lengths to push forward his storyline in a practical manner. Somehow, it turned out that the narratives didn‚Äôt put much effort into unraveling the true essence of how Oppenheim invented the bomb, but merely a touch of the bomb test and a slight whiff of his love story. 

Moreover, it was horrendous that he was shattered a little after his lover left him without much emphasis on it. The storyline isn‚Äôt for everyone due to its convoluted and complex structure as well and it takes a lionheart to delve deep into discerning the true significance of this tale. Anticipating that the movie would end up with the drop of the atomic bomb on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, it kept on going monotonously along the lines. A dreary and bland movie isn‚Äôt all that is in this film, but also a conundrum that is not discerned profoundly. At the climax of the story, the director diverged into a different perspective in order to drill on for three hours with the narrative running into each other and scattered all over the place. 

By the time the director brought the prestigious Albert Einstein out into the picture, it was the middle of the story with barely a glimpse, and he had decided to wind up the whole movie. I am aware of this firm‚Äôs trajectory to cast back the historical moments of ‚ÄòOppenheim: Father of Death,‚Äô but this tale is devoid of interesting and engaging scenes. 

Way to go, Nolan! You completely trash this movie with this awful film. It certainly doesn't live up to his reputation - A below-mediocre, despicable film that is. Don‚Äôt even spend your valuable time looking over at this film. Only a deluded, deranged person would enjoy this type of mundane movie.",@Moviesforyouhere,2024-06-24T01:45:06Z,0,-0.871039628982544,0.006463160738348961,0.11603416502475739,0.8775027990341187,0.0015596371376886964,0.004034846089780331,0.9824945330619812,0.0009250340517610312,0.0017125768354162574,0.0032459828071296215,0.006027427967637777

UgyA7pi1mn0SY9aC3494AaABAg,bK6ldnjE3Y0,Oppenheimer | Official Trailer,Universal Pictures,"This is the MOST DECEIVING trailer and movie of recent times! Read the critics reviews before jumping on the hype like everybody! The movie is NOT about the atomic bomb, but whether Oppenheimer was a communist or not, and all the courtroom trials he had to face. Here the deceiving trailer shows you action, special effects, the preparation for the bomb, electrons and particles swirling around etc. I fell for it, well it's PURE DECEPTION because you will watch very little of these scenes. For ALMOST ALL of the movie duration you'll be watching boring prosecution rooms records, black and white footage - the movie is certainly not all in color as in the trailer... - and endless political debates about Oppenheimer's communist and union affiliations. All of this takes more than 2 hours of the 3 hours of movie duration, while here the courtroom scenes lasts just 5 seconds over the 3 minutes of the trailer (you can count them, they are at the end..), that's why EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS DECEPTION! It is the MOST OVERRATED MOVIE of the recent years. The fact that it won so many Academy Awards it's because it flirts with a prevailing Hollywood narrative that champions leftist views while casting the government and the military in a negative light. The movie glorifies a communist sympathizer who was reluctant to see his creation used for destructive purposes, but was forced to by the military and the power authorities. Left is the hero, right and government are the evil incarnate, Hollywood can't resist but acclaim all that, magnanimously doling out awards after awards like peanuts, more for political solidarity than cinematic merit. At this point who really cares about the Awards and who they are given to.. And surely as hell it will be a long time before I watch another Nolan's product!",@mattberinger2114,2024-04-07T05:45:35Z,4,-0.7863922119140625,0.015842044726014137,0.1819237917661667,0.8022342324256897,0.2012169063091278,0.1633705049753189,0.021106112748384476,0.04625216871500015,0.4827895760536194,0.04271763563156128,0.04254709184169769
