Too bad those explicit scenes have limited the audience for this very relevant film.

Why indulge in something so petty and common as sex when the truth of Atomic devastation could have been depicted explicitly?

Too Political?

Too offensive?

Unprofitable?

Why not EDUCATE people so we DO NOT FORGET?! 

I know people were worried about the Nazis producing the first Atomic bomb, and rightly so, but it was America's research that made it possible for the Russians and Chinese to instigate Mutual Assured Destruction.

UgzWqPgpH3OlzSzgiWJ4AaABAg,bK6ldnjE3Y0,Oppenheimer | Official Trailer,Universal Pictures,"Oppenheim: It is a puzzling, dreadful story that waffles on and on without the true science fiction and technology of concocting the atomic bomb. This cinematic story was all over the place, an amalgamation of intricate and twisted plots, making it tough for any viewers to comprehend and digest. It is somewhat sketchy on top of ambiguous around the storyline I must say.

This film started off being humdrum with a group of people gathering around a table, interrogating Oppenheim about his motives and intentions for creating this atomic bomb. I was initially enthralled with how the film goes back and forth between the past as well as the future but was let down as the story rolled on. 

Besides that, the director wasn‚Äôt ingenious enough to make things straight and go to great lengths to push forward his storyline in a practical manner. Somehow, it turned out that the narratives didn‚Äôt put much effort into unraveling the true essence of how Oppenheim invented the bomb, but merely a touch of the bomb test and a slight whiff of his love story. 

Moreover, it was horrendous that he was shattered a little after his lover left him without much emphasis on it. The storyline isn‚Äôt for everyone due to its convoluted and complex structure as well and it takes a lionheart to delve deep into discerning the true significance of this tale. Anticipating that the movie would end up with the drop of the atomic bomb on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, it kept on going monotonously along the lines. A dreary and bland movie isn‚Äôt all that is in this film, but also a conundrum that is not discerned profoundly. At the climax of the story, the director diverged into a different perspective in order to drill on for three hours with the narrative running into each other and scattered all over the place. 

By the time the director brought the prestigious Albert Einstein out into the picture, it was the middle of the story with barely a glimpse, and he had decided to wind up the whole movie. I am aware of this firm‚Äôs trajectory to cast back the historical moments of ‚ÄòOppenheim: Father of Death,‚Äô but this tale is devoid of interesting and engaging scenes. 

Way to go, Nolan! You completely trash this movie with this awful film. It certainly doesn't live up to his reputation - A below-mediocre, despicable film that is. Don‚Äôt even spend your valuable time looking over at this film. Only a deluded, deranged person would enjoy this type of mundane movie.",@Moviesforyouhere,2024-06-24T01:45:06Z,0,-0.871039628982544,0.006463160738348961,0.11603416502475739,0.8775027990341187,0.0015596371376886964,0.004034846089780331,0.9824945330619812,0.0009250340517610312,0.0017125768354162574,0.0032459828071296215,0.006027427967637777

UgyA7pi1mn0SY9aC3494AaABAg,bK6ldnjE3Y0,Oppenheimer | Official Trailer,Universal Pictures,"This is the MOST DECEIVING trailer and movie of recent times! Read the critics reviews before jumping on the hype like everybody! The movie is NOT about the atomic bomb, but whether Oppenheimer was a communist or not, and all the courtroom trials he had to face. Here the deceiving trailer shows you action, special effects, the preparation for the bomb, electrons and particles swirling around etc. I fell for it, well it's PURE DECEPTION because you will watch very little of these scenes. For ALMOST ALL of the movie duration you'll be watching boring prosecution rooms records, black and white footage - the movie is certainly not all in color as in the trailer... - and endless political debates about Oppenheimer's communist and union affiliations. All of this takes more than 2 hours of the 3 hours of movie duration, while here the courtroom scenes lasts just 5 seconds over the 3 minutes of the trailer (you can count them, they are at the end..), that's why EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS DECEPTION! It is the MOST OVERRATED MOVIE of the recent years. The fact that it won so many Academy Awards it's because it flirts with a prevailing Hollywood narrative that champions leftist views while casting the government and the military in a negative light. The movie glorifies a communist sympathizer who was reluctant to see his creation used for destructive purposes, but was forced to by the military and the power authorities. Left is the hero, right and government are the evil incarnate, Hollywood can't resist but acclaim all that, magnanimously doling out awards after awards like peanuts, more for political solidarity than cinematic merit. At this point who really cares about the Awards and who they are given to.. And surely as hell it will be a long time before I watch another Nolan's product!",@mattberinger2114,2024-04-07T05:45:35Z,4,-0.7863922119140625,0.015842044726014137,0.1819237917661667,0.8022342324256897,0.2012169063091278,0.1633705049753189,0.021106112748384476,0.04625216871500015,0.4827895760536194,0.04271763563156128,0.04254709184169769

It's too weird. 
At that time, Japan was an Asian Nazi
German Nazi = Japanese Empire
Japan's war crimes competed against the German Nazis
At that time, Japan was a twisted and evil country
The Japanese military has slaughtered countless civilians in Asia

Japan's historical distortion, historical revisionism, is too absurd                                
Japan is the same democracy, but it distorts and hides its history
Germany teaches history accurately
The Japanese should emulate the Germans
Come to Korea and study history
There is a lot of historical evidence in Korea
It's an accurate history
Germany and Japan were allies in World War II
As soon as industrialization was successful, Japan waged war and massacred countless civilians
the Asian Holocaust
the Asian Nazis
I must say that American soldier was necessary and it saved at least 20x more lives considering that Imperial Japan never wanted to stop doing Asian holocaust
we have to check the number of civilians killed by the Japanese military during that period
Thank the American soldier for stopping the Asian Nazis
Every country has a dark history. That's one thing. Whether they are ashamed and regret the wrong doings in the past and not cover it up is another
The adults told me a lot of stories
There are so many war crimes committed by Japanese soldiers
But Japan denies history
Japanese right-wing nationalists
Yasukuni Shrine
It's like calling Nazi Hitler a hero
The Japanese should learn the right history instead of pretending to be war victims
Japan should reflect on itself
It's important to learn history correctly for future generations
Koreans don't want compensation   
They want to learn the right history and truly reflect on each other and form a consensus
As soon as Japan invaded Korea
the murder of Empress Myeongseong
At that time, the king of Japan was a god and the king of other countries was a beast
The king of Japan was enshrined as a god, but after the war was defeated, he declared himself a human being
Hirohito
The Japanese are rewriting history by rewriting stories that didn't exist
Historical revisionism is so absurd

I am one and I can't speak for everyone in this subset of this tree, but I'm pretty sure some of us have fully given up, given what we understand about the genetic engineering projects and their implications. I doubt most designer children want to see anything go on for too much longer, lest it be understood what has actually transpired. In this family, the percentage of us who have been genetically designed in laboratory settings have begun to develop a likely unique perspective on the future of humanity. To what extent the public should be allowed to understand certain technological advancements and their myriad, somewhat horrific implications, is dubious to those who are privy to these understandings. I understand some of the more horrific implications of the designer children's movement from the perspective of a Groves designer product.

Ugzv_hPNRvNPawfbySx4AaABAg,H1XEwfOJshU,Oppenheimer | Opening Look,Universal Pictures UK,"It was not the UK that started the Opium War against China, but Jardine Matheson & Co. of the international financial capital Rothschild.At the end of Japan's Edo period, Admiral Matthew Perry, who came to Japan to open up Japan, was related by marriage to the Rothschild family.Japan's Meiji Restoration was a farce of conflict between the British and French Rothschilds for financial control.They instigated the civil war from behind the scenes, lent weapons and funds to both sides, and imposed financial control on the Emperor's side, which they hoped would help them win.For this purpose, Thomas Glover of Matheson & Co. was dispatched to Nagasaki, Japan.Weapons used during the American Civil War were also used in Japan.Japan's invasion of China and annexation of Korea were also part of Rothschild's strategy to dominate Asia using Japan and countermeasures against Russia.They invested huge amounts of capital and know-how in order to allow Japan to expand overseas, leaving Japan mired in debt and forcing it to undergo rapid modernization.That's why the Sino-Japanese War, the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and the Russo-Japanese War occurred.Rothschild gave a huge amount of money to Japan in order to get Japan involved in the Russo-Japanese War.So Japan won the war, but made little profit and prioritized debt repayment.At that time, it was impossible for Japan, which had few resources, to rapidly modernize on its own in a short period of time.The essence of World War I was that the British and French Rothschilds attacked Germany and Italy.Since Japan was financially dominated, Japan had to follow suit in Asia as well.Japan defied international financial capital on its way to freedom from being forever deprived of Asia's vast resources and assets.Japan aimed to become an Asian co-prosperity sphere.Therefore, Japan formed an alliance with Germany and Italy.American Jews pressured Japan to go to war.In order to participate in the war, the United States knew about Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and left it as it was, presenting itself as a victim.Neumann and other Jews developed the atomic bomb from the beginning with the intention of dropping it on Japan.After the war they claimed they had no intention of dropping the atomic bomb on Japan.Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has long been full of Korean residents in Japan, made the declaration of war incomplete and delayed, making it look like a surprise attack from Japan in order to show the world that Japan was malicious.They leaked various information overseas in advance, including the attack on Pearl Harbor.International financial capital also used the Soviet Union, which they would later destroy, to counterattack Japan.They brainwashed China and Korea into thinking that Japan was a vicious invader and perpetrator.China and Korea have been fabricating history and teaching anti-Japan for many years in order to steal money from Japan.In China, the financial capital is obstructing the liberation of Asia, covering up a number of malicious obstructions, and still fabricating stories of impossible massacres and cruel Japanese troops.The annexation of Korea was also the intention of international financial capital.It was a stepping stone to advance to the continent.Japan, reluctant to annex Korea because it would increase debt, abolished the corrupt Korean royal palace, democratized the country, improved the environment, and promoted industry.Korea wanted to become a great power like Japan and repeatedly petitioned Japan for annexation.Korea actively changed its name to Japanese so as not to be ridiculed by Chinese people.After Japan lost the war of liberation in Asia, Korea claimed that Korea was a victim of Japan and that Korea was the victor.Korea is still trying to steal money from Japan by making all kinds of fabrications, such as that they were forcibly annexed, that their names were taken away, that they were massacred and raped, and that they were forcibly taken away.In Japan, Korean residents in Japan have been fabricating history for many years and trying to brainwash Japanese people into thinking that they are the perpetrators.Japanese traitors and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs handed over huge sums of money to China and Korea in order to steal some of the money and hide it overseas.Japanese people who aimed to liberate Asia were judged as war criminals and executed.Emperor Showa Hirohito apologized to MacArthur in order to protect the Japanese people.America still believes the atomic bomb was in retaliation for the attack on Pearl Harbor.The atomic bomb was a retaliation against Japan, which aimed to liberate Asia.Human experiments with different types.The British Prime Minister, who declared a Cold War on behalf of the Rothschilds, authorized the dropping of an atomic bomb on Japan.",@„Åü„Å°„Å™„Åã-x5o,2024-05-25T11:40:12Z,0,-0.5132389068603516,0.014807511121034622,0.4571460485458374,0.5280464291572571,0.4620594084262848,0.00443954486399889,0.023707974702119827,0.1910901814699173,0.07353638857603073,0.18894676864147186,0.056219711899757385
